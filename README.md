# 100-days-of-python-code

I'm building out a 100 days of learning python code tutorial. This will be a project based learning experence with minimal boring stuff. I wanted to better my code writing and knowledge. There are a large amount of tutorial producted by lots of coders over the years, but most are very basic, and I believe, and don't really help you become a real developer or even a better developer. My goal is a better beginner tutorial. I'm learning myself, so maybe this can make us all a little better!
